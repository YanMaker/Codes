These were created when I decided to speed-run teh whole course.

Module 4 (Debugging):

Make sure to make websites accessible to all.
Temporary changes can be made directly in the DOM (Developer Tools).
The order of the box model is MARGIN-->BORDER-->PADDING-->CONTENT. The padding is encompassed by the border, and the margin lies invisible beyond the border.
You can change the individual weight for margins, borders, and paddings in the box model.

Module 5:

Avoid using lots of tables because they:
    ~ Are not screen-reader friendly
    ~ Make the file HUGE
    ~ Are not semantically correct because of lack of content
    ~ Make redesigning harder
    ~ CSS is easier to maintain
